#+TITLE: Modeling single cell data
#+SETUPFILE: setup.org

The development of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technology has
enabled investigation of heterogeneity between individuals cells, dynamics of
cellular processes, and the biological pathways underlying cellular
differentiation. However, a number of features of scRNA-seq data continue to
cause confusion among practitioners applying published methods to analyze new
datasets, as well as researchers developing and benchmarking new methods.
